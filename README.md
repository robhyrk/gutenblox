# Guten Blox Two-Column
A simple Gutenberg custom block that lets users display a feature image in one column, and accompanying text with an image in another column. The user is easily able to switch on which side the content will appear. 

## Motivation
I needed a simple way for the end user to be able to add their own conent using this specific content stack. Could be replicated on other sites so decided to make it a plugin.

Made with Gutenburg components using React and CSS Grid for layout.
